## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze key healthcare performance metrics, patient demographics, and service efficiency.  
By integrating **Power Query for data transformation** and **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for advanced analytics, this report enables **data-driven decision-making** to enhance hospital operations and patient experience.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a **comprehensive healthcare analytics dashboard** using Power BI.  
- Leverage **ETL and DAX** to transform and model raw healthcare data.  
- Visualize **visitor trends**, **wait times**, **satisfaction scores**, and **department-level insights**.  
- Support **data-driven management decisions** through dynamic visuals and filters.

## 🧩 Data Preprocessing (Power Query & DAX)

- **Data Normalization & Imputation:**  
  Applied ETL techniques in Power Query to split, clean, and structure tables.  
  Missing values were imputed to maintain data reliability and analytical accuracy.

- **Data Modeling & Relationships:**  
  Established relationships across tables for seamless aggregation and filtering.  

- **DAX Calculations:**  
  Created measures for KPIs such as total visits, average wait time, and satisfaction score.  
  Enhanced interpretability with calculated columns and time-based aggregations.
